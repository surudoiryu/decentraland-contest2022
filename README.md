### PENGBALL

This game has been submitted to the Decentraland Game Jam 2022 by SurudoiRyu
It is our entry having a fun bowling game where people can chill while playing with balls, we had so many more idea's but had to make cuts for being able to submit our very first ever created Decentraland game with the SDK and builder to set up the world.

# How to play

1) Walk towards the red bowling balls and face them, you can pick them up by pressing `E`

2) Walk towards the `Left` bowling lane (sorry the right lane is out of order... we had some ice excident...)

3) Click your `left mouse button` to power your throw, followed up by another click on the `left mouse button` to change your swing...

4) Try to hit the pins with your throw!

5) Repeat 


# The ball is stuck on the lane

Your ball throw skills suck! Luckely we have made it possible for you to `reset` the game. There is a pedestal with the text `reset` on it... 
Your press `E` while looking at it, standing near.


# Im stuck on the bowlin lanes

You spawned behind the lines, prepare to face some flying bowling balls from others... (Or just press `M` and move your coordinate out of it.)


# What are the future plans ?
We wanted to make this game P2E, so for every strike OR spare you will get points, you can use those points to redeem NFT's.
The NFT's are wearables and will give you slight improvement on your swing, power, pinsize/ballsize etc. 

Unfortunately we didn't had enough time or funds to implement this into the game just now, if we win some land we will look into expanding this game for everyone!
